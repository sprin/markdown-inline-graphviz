Markdown Inline Graphviz/mscgen
===============================

A Python Markdown extension that replaces inline Graphviz and mscgen definitions with
inline SVGs or PNGs!

Why render the graphs/msc inline? No configuration! Works with any
Python-Markdown-based static site generator, such as
[MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), and
[Nikola](https://getnikola.com/) out of the box without configuring an output
directory.

# Installation

    $ pip install markdown-inline-graphviz

# Usage

Activate the `inline_graphviz` extension. For example, with Mkdocs, you add a
stanza to mkdocs.yml:

```
markdown_extensions:
    - inline_graphviz
```

To use it in your Markdown doc:

```
{% dot attack_plan.svg
    digraph G {
        rankdir=LR
        Earth [peripheries=2]
        Mars
        Earth -> Mars
    }
%}
```

Supported graphviz/mscgen commands: mscgen, dot, neato, fdp, sfdp, twopi, circo.
